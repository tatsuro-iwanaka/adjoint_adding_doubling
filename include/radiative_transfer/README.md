# Adjoint Adding Doubling Radiative Transfer Model
This repository contains a C++ implementation of the Adjoint Adding-Doubling Method for plane-parallel radiative transfer problems.
Designed for inverse problems in planetary atmospheric science, this code computes the exact analytical gradients of the cost function with respect to atmospheric parameters.
It utilizes the Eigen library for matrix operations.
Supports both scattering and thermal emission.
